# WNN-Chrome-Extension-Instructions

1. Download the extension from this repository. 
2. Open Google Chrome 
(install Google Chrome if needed - https://www.google.com/chrome/).
5. Open the drop-down menu of the browser.
6. Click on Extensions > Manage Extensions.
7. Enable Developer Mode from the top right corner.
8. Press "Load unpacked".
9. Select the extension's folder and load.

The extension is now loaded and ready to be used.
Upon using YouTube, you will receive recommendations
from the extension.

For the first use, you will not receive any recommendations 
until you watch a few videos, so the system can learn about 
your preferences.

Be mindful that if you constantly see error messages when 
recommendations are retrieved, the agent keep timing out, 
therefore, in the immediate period of time you will not receive 
recommendations.
