# WNN-Chrome-Extension-Instructions

(install Google Chrome if needed - https://www.google.com/chrome/).
5. Open the drop-down menu of the browser.
6. Click on Extensions > Manage Extensions.
7. Enable Developer Mode from the top right corner.
8. Press "Load unpacked".
9. Select the extension's folder and load.

The extension is now loaded and ready to be used.
Upon using YouTube, you will receive recommendations
from the extension.

The idea behind testing is that users will choose recommendations
regardless the recommender. The aim is to compare the KnowingYou
recommender against YouTube recommender. Please choose only the video
you are interested in watching.

For the first use, you will not receive any recommendations 
until you watch a few videos, so the system can learn about 
your preferences. For best results, you must be logged in a 
YouTube account. The extension does NOT collect any personal data.

If you constantly see error messages when recommendations 
are retrieved, it means that the agent is timing out, therefore, 
in the immediate period of time you will not receive 
recommendations.
