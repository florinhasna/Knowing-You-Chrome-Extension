# WNN-Chrome-Extension-Instructions

Thank you for participating in the testing of the KnowingYou Chrome Extension!
For a successful testing session, please keep the extension enabled while watching as many videos as possible. 
It is ideal to test the extension during your natural video-watching experience, rather than solely for the purpose of testing the extension itself.

INSTALLATION:
1. Download the extension from this repository. 
2. Open Google Chrome 
(install Google Chrome if needed - https://www.google.com/chrome/).
5. Open the drop-down menu of the browser.
6. Click on Extensions > Manage Extensions.
7. Enable Developer Mode from the top right corner.
8. Press "Load unpacked".
9. Select the extension's folder and load.

The extension is now loaded and ready to be used.
Upon using YouTube, you will receive recommendations
from the extension.

DIRECTIONS OF USE:
1. Open YouTube in Google Chrome, for best results you must be logged in so you are able to like/dislike, subscribe. 
2. You must see a container with a big header "KnowingYou"
3. At first you must select videos you want to watch by searching or recommended by YouTube.
4. After 6 videos watched, you will start receiving recommendations from KnowingYou.
5. On the homepage or while watching a video you will have options to choose from YouTube or extension's recommendations, choose only videos you would like to watch.
6. The "Display low score videos" will display videos considered by the agent unlikely to be watched.

   THE EXTENSION DOES NOT COLLECT ANY PERSONAL DATA.

The idea behind testing is that users will choose recommendations regardless of the recommender. 
The aim is to compare the KnowingYou recommender against the YouTube recommender. 
Please select only the videos you are interested in watching â€” the more videos you watch, the better the results.

If you are constantly seeing error messages in the container when retrieving recommendations, 
it means that the agent is timing out. As a result, you will not receive recommendations for a period of time.
